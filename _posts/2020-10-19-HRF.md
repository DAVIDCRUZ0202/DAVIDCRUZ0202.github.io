For the past month, I've been working with the organization Human Rights First on their campaign against police brutality. [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/) is an independent organization which works to challenge us all to live up to what it means to be American. They're an amazing organization with almost 40 years of history, fighting to protect the basic rights of human beings. They have a couple of different campaigns, the one which I've been a part of being the Police Brutality watch. With the invention of police body cameras and the widespread availability of mobile recording devices, we have seen an unprecedented amount of footage rise regarding police and their use of force on civilians. It's obvious that the police must be trained for dangerous individuals, but Human Rights First has set out to solve a different problem.

How often is the police use of force actually happening?

Through an interactive, live-updating feed in the form of a map of the United States, we're working to expose all cases of violence between police and civilians. The more exposure we can produce, the more aware the public can be about this issue. We've been working on a tool useful for researchers, experts, activists, and anyone who needs or desires to educate themselves on the true history of our nation.

If we only depended on mainstream media, we're bound to fall victim to the filtering and choosing of only the hardest hitting news stories. By developing a platform independent of outside influence, we can utilize cutting edge technology to develop a tool which is un-biased.

I'm working on the development of the data science API which works to pull raw news stories from various sources, and filter them using a classification model into cases of police brutality. It's a classification problem because we want to evaluate if there is police brutality or no police brutality. This has been an interesting and deeply impactful project. Every couple of days, while working through potiential sources and stories, I'd come across a new video or story of violence. It's very difficult to move forward united with peace when the violence and hatred is so abundantly clear. 

Obviously, as a data scientist, my job is not to be biased and insert my opinions. We developed an unbiased machine learning model through NLP operations. We then proceed by parsing raw stories into readable text. The resulting parsed story is passed through our model so that a prediction is made, and if the model decides that the story is in fact one of police brutality, it gets marked as so, and is passed on to the web team for visual display.
