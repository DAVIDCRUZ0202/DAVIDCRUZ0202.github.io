title: About me
---

My name is David Cruz. I'm a Data Scientist. Except for this page, this portfolio talks about my professional projects, experiences, and insights. This "About Me" page is meant to give a good history of who I am as a person, my background, and what's going on in my life.

### My History

My parents are first-generation immigrants to this country, and they arrived full of ambition and determination. I inherited all of their traits, but the good ones are what have gotten me to where I am today. I grew up during the birth of the internet as we know it today. I learned about a lot of things earlier than I should have, but I also missed on some things that would have helped me grow faster than I did. My years of childhood are filled with both fun memories and hard moments. After public school, I spent my years absorbing knowledge from many different businesses. I've worked in a variety of industries across different positions, each of them contributing to my own ever-growing melting-pot of best practices and ideologies. From flipping burgers to being a fully registered Financial Advisor through the SEC and FINRA, I had come a long way, only to still feel unsatisfied and hungry for more. 

  Before turning Data Science into a full-time career, I had always kept coding as a side hobby. I've built multiple demo micro-video games using the Unity game engine for fun, and I completed a couple of free courses on Google's Codecadamy back in their stages of infancy. Over time, my passion for coding remained intact, but I would always shift focus on my hobbies because of a desire to learn more new things. In pre-Corona times, I held a solid full time job as a sales representative in a gym which I dedicated all of my time to. I was involved in the community as much as I was in the actual work itsself, taking the extra time to participate in my job's events, and going the extra mile to network and keep ties open with everyone I contacted.

Corona shut everything down in New York overnight, which effectively rendered me jobless and imposed a feeling of stagnation upon me. In mid-march, nobody was allowed out of their homes for any reason unless it was to replenish resources. This hit me hard. I hit rock bottom fast. I wasn't so much depressed as I was feeling absolutely frustrated and defeated. My employer originally placed me on "furlough", a status which was quickly replaced with "laid off".

No more than two days after losing my job, I found a link to enroll in Lambda School, an online bootcamp offering a full-time curriculum in multiple different specializations of software engineering and analytics. I fell in love after taking the pre-course work. I knew that the skills gained were not only valuable, but I knew that I had always had kept a passive interest in analytics and insights. The idea of using my strength in analytics to help people was inspiring and motivation for me to succeed. It was time for me to activate my passion. The material wasn't easy by any means, but I grasped the concepts and passed their onboarding exam in time to be enrolled in the Full-Time cohort beginning in April of 2020. This has been one of the most positive, impactful, and life-changing decisions that I have made. I have made countless valuable connections, I've learned in depth concepts and I've successfully applied them in multiple solo and cross-functional projects. I graduated from their Data Science andd Machine Learning Program in October of 2020. In the following ending months of the year, I worked for the school as a technical project lead, where I helped guide students through the collaborative process of working on a cross-functional team. During this time I also juggled a determined and focused job search.

Fast-forward to May of 2021. The world is changing around us. If Co-vid 19 were lemons, me becoming a Data Scientist was my way of making lemonade. I love everything about the industry that I'm in. I love discovering, researching, creating, improving, fixing , and working on projects with renewed energy every day. I'm currently a Junior Data Scientist Apprentice under IBM's Data Science Elite team, where I'm taking the amazing opportunity to work on real-world problems with world-leading experts in the field. I'll work to share some success stories from my team on this blog, as well as my personal projects. Thank you for reading this!
