title: About me
---

My name is David Cruz. I'm a Data Scientist. Except for this page, my entire portfolio talks about my professional projects , experiences, and insights. This page is meant to give a good history of who I am as a person, my background, and what's going on in my life.

### My History

  I'm full of ambition and determination, equipped with a "New York" mindset and an ocean of possibilities. My years after public school were spent absorbing knowledge from many different businesses. I've worked in a variety of industries across different positions, each of them contributing to my own ever-growing melting-pot of best practices and ideologies. From flipping burgers to being a fully registered Financial Advisor through the SEC and FINRA, I had come a long way, only to still feel unsatisfied and hungry for more. 

  Before turning Data Science into a full-time career, I had always kept coding as a side hobby. I've built multiple demo-video games using the Unity game engine for fun, and I completed a couple of free courses on Google's Codecadamy back in their stages of infancy. Over time, my passion for coding remained intact, but I would always shift focus on my hobbies because of a desire to learn more new things. In pre-Corona times, I held a solid full time job as a sales rep. in a gym which I dedicated all of my time to. I was involved in the community as much as I was in the actual work itsself, taking the extra time to participate in my job's events, and going the extra mile to network and keep ties open with everyone I contacted.

Corona shut everything in New York overnight, which effectively rendered me jobless and stationary. In mid-march, nobody was allowed out of their homes for any reason unless it was to replenish resources. A few select industries remained active to serve the public, but this originally only applied to food manufacturing, Union industries(like plumbers and contractors), and public city workers. All retail stores, Gyms, Movie theaters, restuarants, malls, pubs, community centers, schools, libraries, municipalities, EVERYTHING got shut down. This hit me hard. "How could the spread of a virus be so ground-breaking that it has crippled me in means of me generating income ?" Needless to say, I hit rock bottom fast. I wasn't so much depressed as I was feeling absolutely frustrated and defeated. My employer originally placed me on "furlough", a status which was quickly replaced with "laid off" once the facade of what it meant to be "furloughed" was dismantled. They let us go early, and quickly. I'm great friends with my manager from this gym and we still keep in touch.

No more than two days after losing my job, I found a link to enroll in Lambda School. I fell in love after taking the pre-course work. I knew that the skills gained were not only valuable, but I knew that I had always had kept a passive interest in analytics. It was time for me to activate that passion.

The material wasn't easy by any means, but I grasped the concepts and passed their onboarding exam in time to be enrolled in the Full-Time cohort beginning in April of 2020. This has been one of the most positive, impactful, and life-changing decisions that I have made. I have made countless valuable connections, I've learned in depth concepts and I've successfully applied them in multiple solo and cross-functional projects. I'm super excited about the future.

The world is changing around us. If Co-vid 19 were lemons, me becoming a Data Scientist was my way of making lemonade. I love everything about the industry that I'm in. I love discovering, researching, creating, improving, fixing , and working on projects with renewed energy every day. I'm currently working for Lambda School as a Team Project Lead for their Labs Cohort running from the end of November up through the end of the year.
